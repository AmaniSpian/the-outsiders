ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ ***First published in 1967, S. E. Hinton's novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today, with more than eight million copies sold and now available with a perceptive introduction by Jodi Picoult, The Outsiders continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship***

+  ## **A heart-wrenching coming-of-age story that will have you crying by the last page. Hintonâ€™s ability to create realistic and compelling characters speaks to her talented writing ability. The bond between Ponyboy and Johnny is an intimate portrayal of male friendship that isnâ€™t often seen in YA fiction**

+  ## **The Outsiders is about two weeks in the life of a 14-year-old boy. The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for "social") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser**
